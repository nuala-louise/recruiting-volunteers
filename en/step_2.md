People are much more likely to respond positively to a request to do specific tasks rather than fill a role where they are unsure of what is required of them. Volunteer role descriptions outline what a role involves. They ensure both the volunteer and others in the Dojo have a clear understanding of the tasks they will be expected to do.

**Role descriptions usually include:**
+ role title 
+ aims and expectations of role
+ an outline of the role's tasks
+ location, timing and regularity of sessions ie. how long and where you need volunteers to be present

Descriptions can also include why a new volunteer might like to take up the opportunity, how the role fits within the Dojo, expectations of behaviour
as well as desirable skills and qualifications.

## Example role descriptions
Below are six different example volunteer role descriptions that you can adapt to suit the needs of your Dojo.
  
The role descriptions are not exclusive or exhaustive. Many volunteers will have a primary role, but will help out in other areas of the club and with other tasks as required.

title: Clarity with volunteer role descriptions
---

Make sure that your volunteer role description does not read like a job description. You can describe the activities you want them to carry out as "expectations" instead of "jobs" or "requirements". Be clear that it is an unpaid voluntary role, and volunteers can leave at any time.
