<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

Volunteer role descriptions outline what a role involves. They ensure both the volunteer and others in the Dojo have a clear understanding of their role.

**Role descriptions usually include:**
+ role title 
+ aims and expectations of role
+ an outline of the role's tasks
+ location and times

Descriptions can also include why a new volunteer might like to take up the opportunity, how the role fits within the Dojo, expectations of behaviour
as well as desirable skills and qualifications.

## Example role descriptions
Below are six different example volunteer role descriptions that you can adapt to suit the needs of your Dojo.

title: Legal issues with volunteer role descriptions
---

Make sure that your Volunteer role description does not read like a job description. You must be careful not to imply a volunteer is under contract to perform specific tasks. If it looks like you treat them as an employee, they may be eligible for full employment rights and you could be in breach of employment law. Be clear that it is an unpaid voluntary role, and volunteers can leave at any time. Don’t give volunteers an income, avoid asking for a minimum time period commitment and avoid using language used for employment. Words such as ‘contract’, ‘job’ and ‘requirements’ are inappropriate for volunteers, instead the language should be ‘agreement’, ‘role’ and ‘hopes’ or ‘expectations’.
