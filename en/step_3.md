<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

Volunteer role descriptions outline what a role involves. They ensure both the volunteer and others in the Dojo have a clear understanding of their role.

**Role descriptions *usually* include:**
+ role title 
+ aims and expectations of role
+ an outline of the role's tasks
+ location and times

You *could* also include:
+ why a new volunteer might like to take up the opportunity
+ how the role fits within the Dojo
+ expectations of behaviour
+ essential and desirable skills and qualifications

## Example role descriptions
Below are six different example volunteer role descriptions that you can adapt to suit the needs of your Dojo.
