legend: Question 1 of 3
---
What do volunteer role descriptions usually include?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Jargon and complex terminology that doesn't make it clear what tasks the person will be doing during a session.

  --- feedback ---
  
Jargon and technical terms can be off-puytting for volunteers. Use simple and clear language to make sure anyone can read it and understand the type of tasks they will be supporting with.
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) A contract of the job and it's requirements, with a minimum time period commitement.

  --- feedback ---
Volunteer role descriptions should not read like a job description. You must be careful not to imply a volunteer is under contract to perform specific tasks. If it looks like you treat them as an employee, they may be eligible for full employment rights and you could be in breach of employment law. Be clear that it is an unpaid voluntary role, and volunteers can leave at any time. Don’t give volunteers an income, avoid asking for a minimum time period commitment and avoid using language used for employment. Words such as ‘contract’, ‘job’ and ‘requirements’ are inappropriate for volunteers, instead the language should be ‘agreement’, ‘role’ and ‘hopes’ or ‘expectations’.

- (x) The role title, aims and expectations of the role, an outline of tasks, the location and timing of the volunteer role.

  --- feedback ---
Volunteer role descriptions should outline what a role involves. They ensure both the volunteer and others in the Dojo have a clear understanding of their role.
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Only the benefits of volunteering and desirable skills for the role

  --- feedback ---
These can be added to a volunteer description once the more important role elements, such as the role title, aims and expectations of the role, an outline of tasks, the location and timing of the volunteer role are covered.

Descriptions can also include how the role fits within the Dojo and expectations of behaviour.
