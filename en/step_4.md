Some people may have youth work or technical  skills you want in your Dojo, others can help with Dojo admin tasks to help free up technical mentors.  Even if they may not be able to Mentor at the Dojo themselves it’s a great way to spread the word. Are there programmers or people with the skills you need at their places of work?

We recommend that Dojos set up at least one Social Media account to use for promoting your Dojo sessions and finding volunteers & supporters. Start by reaching out to local organisations, tech communities and representatives via your social media channel explaining what CoderDojo is, the benifits and what kind of tasks you are looking for volunteers to support with.
