## Resources to promote

Linked below are some useful resources you can use and adapt to help promote volunteer opportunities for your Dojo. They are organised according to the approach you decide on to reach out to potential volunteers. Communications should include: 
+ key tasks volunteers will support with
+ when they will be needed
+ a clear call to action (what people should do if they are interested)

Some people may have youth work or technical  skills you want in your Dojo, others can help with Dojo admin tasks to help free up technical mentors.  Even if they may not be able to Mentor at the Dojo themselves it’s a great way to spread the word. Are there programmers or people with the skills you need at their places of work?

### Newspaper articles or radio interviews

Utilise your local paper or radio station by proposing to do an article or segment about CoderDojo and your local club. You can then include a call out for Mentors.


### Presentations or visits to local companies


### Current volunteers, sponsors or venue staff asked to recruit others
