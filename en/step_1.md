## Introduction

This course will primarily focus on supporting those involved in managing and running a Dojo to recruit volunteers.

Once completed, you should:
- Understand what tasks volunteers can help with
- Know how to create a volunteer role description
- Have learnt where and how to recruit potential volunteers
- Know what resources are available to help recruit volunteers

## Reflect on your experience
Before looking for new volunteers, it is worth reflecting on how you heard about and became involved in CoderDojo.

**Think** about what motivated you to volunteer. Note down what made your experience rewarding, or challenging.

The motivations of new volunteers may be similar or very different to your own.

**Consider** how you can use your experience to make a new volunteer’s journey a positive experience.

## Reflect on your Dojo's volunteer needs

Dojos usually have volunteers who have some experience working with young people, some who have coding experience, some who are interested in developing these skills, and others who want to help out the Dojo without working directly with young people.

Your Dojo might need volunteers to help with:
+ Setting up the space and computers
+ Talking to young people to help them find solutions for themselves
+ Gathering suitable learning resources and projects
+ Organising snacks and refreshments for longer sessions
+ Fundraising or organising events
+ Technical support for more complex coding languages

## How many volunteers do I need?
The number of volunteers will depend on how many young people attend your sessions, and the type of activities you are doing. Hands-on activities such as physical computing may require more volunteer support.

  Before discussing a volunteer opportunity with someone, it can be useful to have an outline of what you want the volunteer to do, and the benefits of volunteering in mind. Developing a **role description** can be useful for this.
