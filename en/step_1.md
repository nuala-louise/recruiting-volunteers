## Reflect on what volunteer support your Dojo needs

Dojos benefit from having volunteers with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience. 

Dojos usually have volunteers who have some experience working with young people, some who have coding experience, some who are interested in developing these skills, and others who want to help out the Dojo without working directly with young people.

Your Dojo might need volunteers to help with:
+ Setting up the space and computers
+ Encouraging and talking to young people to find the solution themselves
+ Gathering suitable learning resources and projects
+ Organising snacks and refreshments for longer sessions
+ Fundraising or organising 
+ Technical support for more complex projects and coding languages

Reflect on what skills your Dojo already has available. Ask volunteers you already have if they would be interested in upskilling or completing different tasks as part of their role.

Decide what skills or roles are still needed, and whether having surplus volunteers on standby if someone canâ€™t attend would be useful.
