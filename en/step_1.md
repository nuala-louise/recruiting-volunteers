## Reflect on your Dojo's volunteer needs

 

Dojos usually have volunteers who have some experience working with young people, some who have coding experience, some who are interested in developing these skills, and others who want to help out the Dojo without working directly with young people.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Dojos benefit from having volunteers with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience.
</p>

Your Dojo might need volunteers to help with:
+ Setting up the space and computers
+ Talking to young people to find the solution themselves
+ Gathering suitable learning resources and projects
+ Organising snacks and refreshments for longer sessions
+ Fundraising or organising events
+ Technical support for more complex coding languages

Before discussing a volunteer opportunity with someone it can be useful to have an outline of what you want the volunteer to do, and the benefits of volunteering in mind. Developing a role description can be useful for this.
