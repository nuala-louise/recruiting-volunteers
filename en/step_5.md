**Think** about how you want those who are interested to contact you about the volunteer oppurtunity. 

--- /task ---
 
This will depend on the approach you have chosen.
  
You might ask those who see a poster, or see a newspaper advertisement to email the Dojo's email address if they are interested.
You could suggest those who see a social media post about it, to comment on the post or directly message you on that channel.
If you are talking to someone you know, you might give them your mobile number to call you back once they have thought about it.

**Decide** how you want interested people to follow up about the oppourtunity. Make sure this is easy for those who hear about the oppurtunity.

Once your opportunity is shared, be ready to respond to any interest. When you receive responses:
  
--- task ---

Respond quickly and politely to ensure that the first impression of your Dojo is a positive one.

--- /task ---
  
--- task ---

Share more detailed information about the Dojo, the role and expectations. 
  
--- /task ---
  
This will help people to decide on whether the role is a good fit for them or not. The role description you developed earlier should help with this.

--- task ---

Invite them along to visit your Dojo so that they can find out more and so you can get to know them too. Alternatively you could arrange to meet them in a public place.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Remember:** visitors who haven’t obtained a background check, should be accompanied by a vetted volunteer at all times and not be left unattended with young people. 
</p>
  
Not every response leads to a new volunteer onboarding, and that’s okay! If this happens, firstly, thank people for their interest, but also use the opportunity to get any feedback around why the role may not have been a good fit.
This feedback may help you to consider:

+ Any alternative roles for the individual
+ Tweaking or clarifying your role description if this may improve future recruitment
+ Flexibility, is there a way that you could accommodate specific needs?
