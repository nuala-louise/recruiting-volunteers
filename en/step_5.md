How people respond will depend on the approach you have chosen to promote volunteer oppurtunities.
  
--- task ---
  
**Think** about how you want those who are interested to contact you about the volunteer opportunity. 

--- /task ---
 
You might ask those who see a poster, or see a newspaper advertisement to **email** the Dojo's email address if they are interested.
  
You could suggest those who see a social media post about it, to **comment** on the post or **directly message** you on that channel.
  
If you are talking to someone you know, you might give them your mobile number to **call you back** once they have thought about it. 
  
If you are posting about volunteer opportunities online you might provide a link to an **online form** (eg. Google Form) for potential volunteers to fill out.
  

--- task ---
  
**Decide** how you want interested people to follow up about the opportunity. Make sure this is easy for those who hear about the opportunity.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Choose a contact method that you **check and use regularly**, so it is easy for you to respond promptly to inquiries.

Once your opportunity is shared, be ready to respond to any interest. When you receive responses:

4. Select the ‘user requests’ tab to see those who have requested to join your Dojo as volunteers

Once accepted, volunteers will show in your "Active Users" section and you will be able to email them and invite them to upcoming events through the platform.

--- task ---

**Share** more detailed information about the Dojo, and answer any questions they have about the role. 
  
--- /task ---
  
This will help people to decide on whether the role is a good fit for them or not. The role description you developed earlier should help with this.

--- task ---

**Invite them to visit your Dojo** so that they can find out more and so you can get to know them too. Alternatively you could arrange to meet them in a public place.

--- /task ---

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Remember:** visitors who haven’t obtained a background check, should be accompanied by a vetted volunteer at all times and not be left unattended with young people. 
</p>
  
Not every response leads to a new volunteer joining your Dojo, and that’s okay! When this happens, firstly, thank people for their interest, but also use the opportunity to get any feedback around why the role may not have been a good fit.
This feedback may help you to consider:

+ Any alternative roles for the individual
+ Tweaking or clarifying your role description if this may improve future recruitment
+ Flexibility, is there a way that you could accommodate specific needs?
